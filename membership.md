In order to support our [mission](../team){:target="_blank"}, Cumberland Valley Collective (CVC) collects dues from our members to not only supplement the support that we get from our generous sponsors, but also to foster a sense of commitment and accountability among members, ensuring everyone shares in the responsibility of sustaining the team's operations and goals.

Dues for 2025 will be a total of $65 and consist of two separate payments - both are required to join.

1. FCC - As part of our partnership with the Franklin County Cyclists (FCC), CVC members are also required to pay an annual $20 membership fee to the FCC. When paying for your membership, **be sure to check the box for "I am riding for Cumberland Valley Collective"** for their tracking purposes (screenshot at the bottom of this page). [Click here to pay your FCC membership fee](https://www.franklincountycyclists.com/fcc-store/p/2024-membership){:target="_blank"}.
