In order to support our [mission](../team), Cumberland Valley Collective collects dues from our members to not only supplement the support that we get from our generous sponsors, but also foster a sense of commitment and accountability among members, ensuring everyone shares in the responsibility of sustaining the team's operations and goals.

Dues for 2025 will be a total of $65 and consist of two separate payments - both are required to join.

1. FCC - As part of our partnership with the Franklin County Cyclists, CVC members are also required to pay their yearly $20 membership fee to the FCC. When paying for your membership, **be sure to check the box for "I am riding for Cumberland Valley Collective"** for their tracking purposes (screenshot at the bottom of this page). [Click here to pay your FCC membership fee](https://www.franklincountycyclists.com/fcc-store/p/2024-membership). 
2. CVC - The remainder of your dues ($45) will be paid to Cumberland Valley Collective. Use [this link to pay your 2025 CVC membership dues](https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/CUYWZKEWBM9J4).
