A few collectivists took a trip down to Blacksburg, Virginia to do a bit of bikepacking exploration in the mountains and valleys nearby. 

Day 1 
-----
Kyle, Ben, Nathan, Scott, and I (Darin) loaded up our bikes with enough gear to camp out for two nights out in the woods. After a brief highway climb on pavement, the we were on gravel and sending it down a forest road towards the New River. After 25 miles of pavement, we took a quick detour to stop at J&J's grocery for some snacks.

A quaint store that also sells hot food, but at 10:30a we just stocked up on drinks and snacks to make it through to the next store at mile 125. 
Being loaded up, we went up. Way up. From 1,700ft at J&J's all the way up to the top of Sugar Run Mountain just shy of 4,100ft. After climbing at 7.5% for 45 minutes, we were greeted with a gate and what looked like a wall of rocks. With the promise of a view of the valley at the top, we grinded up the remaining 350ft of climbing at nearly 15% average on golf-ball sized gravel. 

It was worth the view.

After descending back down the brutal rock wall, we were back on crushed gravel to descend off the mountain heading west towards our final destination for the day: Burkes Garden. Unfortunately, Kyle took a spill on some loose gravel around a tight turn and lost some skin. Thankfully we had some antibiotic ointment and some tegaderm so we got him cleaned up. Thankfully there was a flowing creek not 50ft from the crash site so we took the time to filter water and top off our reserves.

Now 54 miles and 5,400ft of climbing in we started up Hogback Ridge Road. This probably should have been named "Hogback Ridge Trail". It was fairly rough double track with lots of elevation undulation and trail-wide puddles to navigate.

Goates led the charge on the descent off Hogback but unfortunately the hog bucked him off and he ended up in a ditch. We were originally worried he had serious injuries but he got up and moving around pretty quickly and seemed fine. We'd later find out he bruised his hip pretty badly but he rode on. 

At this point, we're off Hogback but those 11 miles took us over two hours, much longer than we had hoped. We were all very nearly out of water. The next water crossing on the map was at least 10 miles of potentially rough gravel miles away so we bailed out down the mountain to the town of Bland to a Dollar General. Boy was that nice. After purchasing and consuming copious amounts of snacks and drinks, topping off water, and reviving our spirits, we headed back towards the mountain and our final two climbs of the day.

Now 75 miles in and nearly 10 hours since we departed that morning, we were at the base of our next obstacle: a 5 mile, 1,600ft, 5% gravel climb. After riding nearly 45 minutes of smooth gravel, we reached what looked like a dead end but noticed a horse path through the rocks. Thankfully the path led to a gravel descent that led us to Burkes Garden, a geological basin at 3,000ft with mountains completely encircling it at 4,000ft. It was hard to capture with a photo, but man the view of that was something else. Ben got a cool pic of us enjoying the view though.

Only one more climb stand between us and our hopes of a campsite. We topped off our water after filtering water from the Snyder Branch creek (pronounded "crik") and started our final ascent. This climb was full of views and ideal gravel. What a way to end the day. It was almost 8pm by the time we got to the top. When we approached the top we were elated to see that there was a primitive campsite complete with a fire ring. Even better, we found gallons of water. The top of this climb intersects with the Appalachian Trail and a trail angel had put a handful of gallon jugs of water at the intersection of the road and the trail. We set up camp, enjoyed our dehydrated meals and whatever leftover loot we had from the Dollar General. Exhausted after 91 miles, 10,500ft of climbing, and over 8 hours of riding time, we crawled into our tents and enjoyed the cool 65F temp at the top of the mountain as we drifted off to sleep. Quite a day.
